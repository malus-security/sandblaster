## SandBlaster: Reversing the Apple Sandbox

SandBlaster is a tool for reversing (decompiling) binary Apple sandbox profiles.
Apple sandbox profiles are written in
SBPL (*Sandbox Profile Language*), a Scheme-like language, and are then compiled
into an undocumented binary format and
shipped. Primarily used on iOS, sandbox profiles are present on macOS as well.
SandBlaster is, to our knowledge, the
first tool that reverses binary sandbox profiles to their original SBPL format.
SandBlaster works on iOS from version 7
onwards including iOS 11.

The technical
report [SandBlaster: Reversing the Apple Sandbox](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04303)
presents extensive (
though a bit outdated) information on SandBlaster internals.

SandBlaster relied on previous work
by [Dionysus Blazakis](https://github.com/dionthegod/XNUSandbox) and Stefan
Esser's [code](https://github.com/sektioneins/sandbox_toolkit)
and [slides](https://www.slideshare.net/i0n1c/ruxcon-2014-stefan-esser-ios8-containers-sandboxes-and-entitlements)
.

The reverser (in the `reverse-sandbox/` folder) and the helper tool (in
the `helpers/` folder) run on any Python running
platform.

SandBlaster may be installed and run standalone, though we recommend installing
and running it from
within [iExtractor](https://github.com/malus-security/iExtractor). Check
the [iExtractor documentation](https://github.com/malus-security/iExtractor/blob/master/README.md)
for information.

iExtractor is open source software released under the 3-clause BSD license.

## Installation

SandBlaster requires Python2 for the reverser (in `reverse-sandbox/`), Python3
with `lief` library for helper script (
in `helpers/`).

After cloning the SandBlaster repository, you have to install `lief` for
Python3:

```bash
pip3 install lief
```

If the installation of `lief` fails you need compile to it. More information
about how to compile it can be found on
the [wiki page](https://lief.quarkslab.com/doc/stable/compilation.html).

## Usage

In order to use SandBlaster you need access to the binary sandbox profiles and
the sandbox operations, a set of strings
that define sandbox-specific actions. Sandbox operations and sandbox profiles
are extracted using
the `helpers/extract_sandbox_data.py` script. Sandbox profiles are extracted
from the kernel sandbox extension (as a
bundle for iOS 4 and 9-11) or from kernel cache (as a bundle for iOS 12) or from
the `sandboxd` file in the iOS
filesystem (for iOS 5-8). Sandbox operations are extracted either from kernel
extension (for iOS 4-11) or from kernel
cache (for iOS 12).

So, as input data, SandBlaster requires the kernelcache, the kernel sandbox
extension and the `sandboxd` file.
Information and scripts on extracting them from a publicly available IPSW (*
iPhone Software*) file is presented
by [iExtractor](https://github.com/malus-security/iExtractor).

Below are the steps and commands to reverse the sandbox profiles for iOS 8.4.1,
assuming the sandbox kernel
extension (`com.apple.security.sandbox.kext`) and the `sandboxd` file are
available:

```bash
# Extract sandbox operations from kernelcache.
cd helpers/
./extract_sandbox_data.py -o iPad2,1_8.4.1_12H321.sb_ops iPad2,1_8.4.1_12H321.
com.apple.security.sandox.kext 8.4.1
# Extract binary sandbox profile files from sandboxd.
mkdir iPad2,1_8.4.1_12H321.sandbox_profiles
./extract_sandbox_data.py -O iPad2,1_8.4.1_12H321.sandbox_profiles/ iPad2,1_8.4
.1_12H321.sandboxd 8.4.1
# Reverse all binary sandbox profiles.
cd ../reverse-sandbox/
mkdir iPad2,1_8.4.1_12H321.reversed_profiles
for i in ../helpers/iPad2,1_8.4.1_12H321.sandbox_profiles/*; do python
reverse_sandbox.py -r 8.4.1 -o ../helpers/iPad2,1_8.4.1_12H321.sb_ops -d iPad2
,1_8.4.1_12H321.reversed_profiles/ "$i"; done
```

Below are the steps and commands to reverse the sandbox profiles for iOS 9.3,
assuming the sandbox kernel
extension (`com.apple.security.sandbox.kext`) is available:

```bash
# Extract sandbox operations from kernelcache.
cd helpers/
./extract_sandbox_data.py -o iPhone5,1_9.3_13E237.sb_ops iPhone5,1_9.3_13E237.
com.apple.security.sandox.kext 9.3
# Extract sandbox profile bundle from kernel sandbox extension.
./extract_sandbox_data.py -O . iPhone5,1_9.3_13E237.com.apple.security.sandox.
kext 9.3
cd ../reverse-sandbox/
# Reverse all binary sandbox profiles in sandbox bundle.
mkdir iPhone5,1_9.3_13E237.reversed_profiles
# Print all sandbox profiles in bundle.
python reverse_sandbox.py -r 9.3 -o ../helpers/iPhone5,1_9.3_13E237.sb_ops -d
iPhone5,1_9.3_13E237.reversed_profiles/ ../helpers/sandbox_bundle -psb
# Do actual reversing.
python reverse_sandbox.py -r 9.3 -o ../helpers/iPhone5,1_9.3_13E237.sb_ops -d
iPhone5,1_9.3_13E237.reversed_profiles/ ../helpers/sandbox_bundle
```

The extraction of the binary sandbox profiles differs between iOS <= 8 and iOS >
= 9. Since iOS >= 9 the binary sandbox
profiles are stored in a sandbox bundle in the kernel sandbox extension.
The `helpers/extract_sandbox_data.py` script
extracts them appropriately depending on the iOS version.

The `-psb` option for `reverse_sandbox.py` prints out the sandbox profiles part
of a sandbox bundle without doing the
actual reversing.

The `reverse_sandbox.py` script needs to be run in its
directory (`reverse-sandbox/`) since it needs the other Python
modules and the `logger.config` file.

## Internals

The `helpers/` subfolder contains helper scripts that provide a nicer interface
for the external tools.

The actual reverser is part of the `reverse-sandbox/` folder. Files here can be
categorized as follows:

* The main script is `reverse_sandbox.py`. It parses the command line arguments,
  does basic parsing of the input binary
  file (extracts sections) and calls the appropriate functions from the other
  modules.
* The core of the implementation is `operation_node.py`. It provides functions
  to build the rules graph corresponding to
  the sandbox profile and to convert the graph to SBPL. It is called
  by `reverse_sandbox.py`.
* Sandbox filters (i.e. match rules inside sandbox profiles) are handled by the
  implementation in `sandbox_filter.py`
  and the configuration in `filters.json`, `filter_list.py` and `filters.py`.
  Filter specific functions are called
  by `operation_node.py`.
* Regular expression reversing is handled by `sandbox_regex.py`
  and `regex_parse.py`. `regex_parse.py` is the back end
  parser that converts the binary representation to a basic
  graph. `sandbox_regex.py` converts the graph
  representation (an automaton) to an actual regular expression (i.e. a string
  of characters and metacharacters). It is
  called by `reverse_sandbox.py` for parsing regular expressions, with the
  resulting regular expression list being
  passed to the functions exposed by `operation_node.py`; `operation_node.py`
  passes them on to sandbox filter handling
  files.
* The new format for storing strings since iOS 10 is handled
  by `reverse_string.py`. The primary `SandboxString` class
  in `reverse_string.py` is used in `sandbox_filter.py`.
* Logging is configured in the `logger.config` file. By default, `INFO` and
  higher level messages are printed to the
  console, while `DEBUG` and higher level messages are printed to
  the `reverse.log` file.

## Supported iOS Versions

SandBlaster works for iOS version 4 onwards including iOS 12. Apple has been
making updates to the binary format of the
sandbox profiles: since iOS 9 sandbox profiles are stored in a bundle, since iOS
10 strings are aggregated together in a
specialied binary format. iOS 11 didn't bring any change to the format.
